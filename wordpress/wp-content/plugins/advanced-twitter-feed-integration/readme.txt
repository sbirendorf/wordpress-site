Advanced Twitter Feed Integration allows you to easily customise your twitter feed with widgets and shortcodes.

== Description ==

The Advanced Twitter Feed Integration (ATFI) can be easily integrated into any WordPress theme that uses widgets. Not only this but you can also integrate a twitter feed into any post, page or WordPress template using our simple shortcodes.

Featuring two separate types of Twitter Feed (the Timeline API and the Search API) you can quickly display your latest tweets or specific hashtag/search term.

As of June 2013 Twitter updated their API to version 1.1 (which requires authentication), we have provided an easy-to-follow guide with this plugin that will show you how to generate all your required API keys through a simple step-by-step process.

Additional to this, we have also integrated API errors into the settings page. If your Twitter Feed generates any errors, such as API credentials being incorrect or the Twitter API being unresponsive, you can see these inside the 'Errors' tab within 'Settings > Advanced Twitter Feed Integration'. The Errors tab only appears if there are errors present.

To combat the Twitter API usage limits we have also included a caching feature. The caching feature will always show the most recent 'successful' feed to your visitors - until the API limit is lifted or normal service resumes on Twitter. 

Here are some of the main features:

* Twitter API 1.1 Compatible
* Timeline & Search API integration
* Easy to use Widgets & Shortcodes
* Twitter Display Guidelines Compliant
* Customisable display (change links, display avatar etc)
* Caching System
* Error reporting
* Quick API test tool

Please follow our simple guide located within 'Settings > Advanced Twitter Feed Integration' (in the 'How Do I Generate My API Keys?' tab)

= I've entered my Twitter API credentials but my Widget is still not showing? =

Please check to make sure that you have dragged our widget into your widget areas. If the widget is still not appearing please check to see if there is an error tab within 'Settings > Advanced Twitter Feed Integration'.

Widget options are only available once you have entered your API information

Widgets will not display unless your theme is Widget-Compatible. Please ensure that your theme still contains its widget functionality (i.e. it's not been commented out)
